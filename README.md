#### [Video Demo]  <URL HERE>
## Description:
#### Welcome to my A* Algorithm visualizer app in Kivy! This is the final project for [CS50x Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). This app allows you to visualize the pathfinding algorithm known as A* in action. Simply input the start and end nodes, add barriers, and run the A* algorithm to see the shortest path between the two nodes. The interface is easy to use and intuitive, allowing you to focus on exploring the algorithm and experimenting with different scenarios. Give it a try and see for yourself!

## Technologies:
#### Language: Python 3.11.1
#### Framework: kivy 2.2.0
#### In order to run the application please: 
#### • clone the repository
#### • download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already done
#### • download [kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html) framework and the required dependencies
#### • if your kivy version is different please modify the astar.kv file accordingly

## Usage:
#### Once the app is running you can start interacting with it.
#### • First click set the start node
#### • Second click set the end node
#### • Following clicks will set the barrier nodes
#### • If needed it is possible to erase a barrier node by re-clicking it
#### • To start the algorithm visualiser press -spacebar-
#### • To reset the app press -enter-
#### • To quit the app press -esc- or quit it from the window
